# REVERSE PROXY FILE-SHARING
TODO: fix file uploads for bigger files, better error treatment, friendly UI, deploy, Windows compatibility

Simple reverse proxy file-sharing service written in C using sockets\

## Reverse Proxy
A reverse proxy is an intermediary server that acts as a 'bridge' between the client and the proxy server. To the client this will seem like any old regular web server, but reverse proxy increases scalability, security and performance compared to a straight access from the user to the proxy server. This implementation is quite simple, only connecting the client to one backend server and allowing them to get files.

## Implementation
This implementation only works on UNIX systems, seeing as it uses the <sys/socket.h> Berkley Sockets implementation. We use sockets to connect the three parts of the system (the client, the reverse proxy service, and the backend) together in a simple and readable way. We have two sockets, one that talks to the client and one that talks to the backend. The reverse proxy serves as a middleman that manages the communication between both sides, receiving data from one socket (client or backend) and redirecting it to the other

Simple schematic of how the system works:

<sup>Made with draw.io</sup>

## How to run
First, compile the backend and revproxy files:

`make`\

Then, run both at the same time\
`./backend`\
`./revproxy`

## Available endpoints

If you are trying to reach the endpoints from another machine (in the same network), make sure the 4950 port is open in your server's firewall and replace localhost with the server's IP.

### GET a file hosted in the server:
Example:\
`curl http://localhost:4950/test.txt`
Will return:\
`Hello world!`

Example 2:\
`curl http://localhost:4950/revproxy.drawio.png --output diagram.png`\
Will download the diagram shown above

### GET a list of all files available in the server:
Example:\
`curl http://localhost:4950/list`\
Will return a list of all available files

### POST send a file to the server:
`curl -F "file=@test.txt" http://localhost:4950/upload`\
Will send test.txt and save it in the server\
Obs: Doesn't support all file formats yet, only tested throughly with text files
